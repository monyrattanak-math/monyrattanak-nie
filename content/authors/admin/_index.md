I am a lecturer at RUPP (Royal University of Phnom Penh). I pursued and obtained my postgraduate degrees from Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas (CIMAT), Mexico under direction of <a href="https://www.cimat.mx/~quiroga/" target="_blank"> Dr. Raúl Quiroga Barranco</a>. 

I obtained a master degree with a thesis entitle: <a href="https://cimat.repositorioinstitucional.mx/jspui/bitstream/1008/732/1/TE%20639.pdf" target="_blank"> Matrix Lie Groups and Lie Correspondences</a> that is about Lie groups that are subgroups or isomorphic to subgroups of general linear group and relations to their Lie algebras. My PhD research focused on C*-algebras generated by Toeplitz operators. The goal is to find such commutative algebras. The first part was to use the theory of representation of Lie groups and Lie algebras and the second part is to related the problem to a moment map that is an important concept in symplectic geometry.
